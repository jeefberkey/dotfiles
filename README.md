* Fedora 29
* [swaywm/sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/) is my window manager
* [waybar](https://github.com/alexays/waybar) made a custom statusbar
* [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) is my launcher
* I have a few gnome-terminal tweaks in the gtk css, because I can't be bothered enough to try the 'cooler' terminals
* [mako](https://github.com/emersion/mako) manages my notifications
* I'm using nvim, and have vim aliased to nvim, but I use Atom most of the time.
* [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) is my shell, you can check out my plugins and other conf in [.zshrc](.zshrc)
* [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) is my theme manager, with a wallpaper from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com) that has a few different colors so my terminal theme comes out with enough contrast
* [ranger](https://ranger.github.io/) is my file manager when Atom's file tree isn't useful
* I have a bunch of useful Vagrantfiles in [vagrant-playground](vagrant-playground)

Other useful software I don't feel like managing submodules for:
* firefox nightly bin
* [Color-Scripts](https://github.com/stark/Color-Scripts)
